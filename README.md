Data Processing
Following is a description of data processing techniques used in this case.
Hanning Window: First the data were chopped up into overlapping 1-second ‘frames’ and a Hanning window was applied.
Fast Fourier Transform (FFT): FFT was applied to transform data for each frame from time domain to frequency domain.


Network Architecture
A convolutional neural network was iteratively constructed and tuned to give the best classification accuracy with the data available.
